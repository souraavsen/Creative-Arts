              in athletic and recreational situations, as well as in academic
              scenarios such as penmanship lessons.Drawing plays a big role in
              our cognitive development. It can help us learn to write and think
              creatively, develop hand-eye co-ordinationand conceptualise ideas.{" "}

              Drawings release mental energy that was unconsciously repressed.
              From this mental energy, even people faced with difficulties may
              be able to overcome their problems. It could be said that it is
              basis for which drawing is used as a psychological treatment.
